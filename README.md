# TypeScript Review 3 (RT3)

This repository contains the **RT3** activity of the **Programming Techniques 1** discipline, developed during the **Multiplatform Software Development (DSM)** course at FATEC.

## 📌 Description

This activity focuses on the creation and reuse of modules in TypeScript. It consists of a module that defines classes to perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and another module that imports and uses these classes to execute calculations.

The goal is to apply modularization principles to make components reusable across different projects.

## 🛠️ Technologies used

- TypeScript
- Node.js (for execution)
- Visual Studio Code (development environment)

## 📊 Status
